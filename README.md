.I created Health Care the website.
.I have given a banner on the website, I am using slider as a banner.
.Make the home page of my website responsive. Make sure the site looks different on desktop and mobile responsive. 
.I implement Email-password based authentication. I have to implement the Registration and the login page. Users should be able to toggle between Login and Registration view. I use react firebase hook to implement the login system.
.If I reload the protected/private route (after login), this page will not redirect the user to the login page. Instead, it will keep the logged-in user on the protected route.
