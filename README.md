.I created Health Care the website.

.I have given a banner on the website, I am using slider as a banner.

.Make the home page of my website responsive. Make sure the site looks different on desktop and mobile responsive. 

.I implement Email-password based authentication. I have to implement the Registration and the login page. Users should be able to toggle between Login and Registration view. I use react firebase hook to implement the login system.

.If I reload the protected/private route (after login), this page will not redirect the user to the login page. Instead, it will keep the logged-in user on the protected route.

.Clicking on the button will take the user to the Checkout route. This route had private/protected routes. Please I make sure that the private route redirects to the login page if the user is not logged in. After login, the user will be redirected to the checkout page
